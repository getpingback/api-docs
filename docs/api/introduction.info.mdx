Understand general concepts, response codes, and authentication strategies.

## Base URL
The Pingback API is built on **REST** principles. We enforce **HTTPS** in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support **HTTP**.

All requests contain the following base URL:

```
https://connect.pingback.com/v1
```

---

## Authentication

The Pingback API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can request and manage your API keys with our [**support team**](https://helpcenter.pingback.com/).

To authenticate you need to add an Authorization header with the contents of the header being `x-api-key: ***` where `***` is your API Key.

```
x-api-key: ***
```

Your API key is unique to your account and should be kept secure. Do not share your API key in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so on.

We also encrypt your API key in our database to ensure that it is secure, using `AES-256` encryption.

## Response Codes

Pingback uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, `2xx` HTTP codes correspond to success, `4xx` codes are for user-related failures, and `5xx` codes are for infrastructure issues.

| Code   | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `200`  | OK          |
| `201`  | Created     |
| `403`  | Forbidden   |
| `404`  | Not Found   |
| `409`  | Conflict    |
| `422`  | Unprocessable Entity |
| `429`  | Too Many Requests |
| `500`  | Internal Server Error |

## Rate Limiting

Pingback enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage of the API. If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a `429` status code.

The maximum number of requests that users can send is **5 requests per second**.

The burst rate is **2 requests** at a time.

To prevent this, we recommend reducing the rate at which you request the API. This can be done by introducing a queue mechanism or reducing the number of concurrent requests per second. If you have specific requirements, contact [**support team**](https://helpcenter.pingback.com/).

## Support

If you have any questions or need help, please contact our [**support team**](https://helpcenter.pingback.com/).

Each request to the API will return a `requestId` inside the body. If you need to contact support, please provide this `requestId` to help us identify your request.
