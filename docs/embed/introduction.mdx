# Introduction

Pingback provides you with ready-to-use embeddable forms directly inside your website.

Easily collect data from your users without the need to build forms from scratch. Pingback embeddable forms are customizable, secure, and easy to integrate into your website.

## Setup

To get started, you need to include the Pingback script in your website. You can do this by adding the following script tag to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://widget.pingback.com"></script>
```

You can add this script tag to the `<head>` or `<body>` section of your HTML file.

## Usage

### Embedding a Form

To embed a form in your website, add the following HTML snippet to your page:

```html
<pb-embeddable-form channel_id="your_channel_id"></pb-embeddable-form>
```

Replace `your_channel_id` with the ID of the channel you want to use for the form. If you don't know the channel ID, you can ask our [**support team**](https://helpcenter.pingback.com/).

### Options

All the attributes can be setup without the need to write any JavaScript code. Just go to the [Embed page](https://pingback.com/publish/settings/embed) in your Pingback account and copy the code snippet.

However, if you want to have a better understanding, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the form by passing additional attributes to the `<pb-embeddable-form>` tag. Here are some of the available options:

#### Behavior

- `channel_id`: The ID of the channel you want to use for the form.
- `segment_id`: The ID of the segment you want to use for the form. _Optional_.
- `product_id`: The ID of the product you want to use for the form. _Optional_.

#### Customizing

- `call_to_action`: The text displayed on the submit button. Default is _"Inscrever"_.
- `thanks_message`: The message displayed to the user after submitting the form. Default is _"Inscrição realizada com sucesso! Em breve você receberá novidades por email."_. If you want to redirect the user after submitting the form, you can use the `redirect_url` attribute instead.
- `redirect_url`: The URL to redirect the user after submitting the form. _Optional_.
- `theme_mode`: The color theme of the form:
  - `light` _Default_.

#### Predefined Fields

Email is a required field. You can choose to show or hide the name and phone fields:

- `show_name`: Whether to show the name field. Default is `false`.
- `show_phone`: Whether to show the phone field. Default is `false`.

#### Custom Fields

You can add custom fields to the form by using the ones that are available in your channel. If you don't know the available fields, you can ask our [**support team**](https://helpcenter.pingback.com/).

You can add up to 5 custom fields to the form. The attribute name should follow the pattern `custom_field_<index>`, where `<index>` is a number from 1 to 5.

The available attributes are:

- `custom_field_<index>_id`: The ID of the custom field.
- `custom_field_<index>_type`: The type of the custom field. Possible values are:
  - `text`
  - `dropdown`
- `custom_field_<index>_label`: The label of the custom field.
- `custom_field_<index>_helper`: The helper text of the custom field. _Optional_.
- `custom_field_<index>_options`: The options of the custom field. Required for dropdown fields. Example: `"Option 1, Option 2,Option 3"`.
