# Introduction

Pingback offers customizable and secure embeddable forms for easy integration into your website, eliminating the need to build forms from scratch.

These forms are designed to seamlessly collect data from your users with minimal effort.

Explore various implementations and get inspired by visiting our [Demos page](/docs/embed/demos).

## Setup

Insert the following script tag in the `<head>` or `<body>` section of your HTML file to integrate Pingback into your website:

```html
<script src="https://widget.pingback.com"></script>
```

## Usage

### Embedding a Form

Insert the below HTML snippet where you want the form to appear on your page:

```html
<pb-embeddable-form channel_id="your_channel_id"></pb-embeddable-form>
```

Replace `your_channel_id` with the actual channel ID. If you're unsure of the channel ID, contact our [**support team**](https://helpcenter.pingback.com/).

### Options

All attributes can be set up without writing any code. Simply visit the [Embed page](https://pingback.com/publish/settings/embed) in your Pingback account and copy the code snippet provided.

For those who want to dive deeper, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the form by adding additional attributes to the `<pb-embeddable-form>` tag. Below are some of the options you can configure:
