## Development

### Getting Started

```bash
yarn dev
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Generate API Documentation

yarn gen-api-docs
```

This command generates API documentation from the `specs/api.yaml` file. The generated documentation is stored in the `docs/api` directory.
